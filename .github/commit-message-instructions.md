# Commit Message Generation Instructions

Use Semantic Commit Messages format exactly: `<type>: <subject>`.

## Allowed Types

Only these `<type>` values: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, test.

## Subject Rules

- Present tense, start with a verb
- Keep it concise (<= 72 chars)
- No trailing period

## Body (if needed)

Keep it short: 1-3 bullet points describing what changed, no extra fluff.
